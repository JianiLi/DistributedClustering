### Case Study - Digit Classification
The task is to classify the digits into ten classes from 0-9.

### Dataset
- MNIST and synthetic digits with random embedded background.

### Instructions
Tested on python 3.5

- Run main.py to reproduce the results shown in the paper.
	- In main.py, we simulate four cases: "no-cooperation", "loss", "distance", " average", as explained in the paper.
	- "numAgents" is the total number of agents in the network.
- Run plot.py to generate Fig.7 in the paper.
- Run plotWeightMatrix to generate weight matrix (Fig.6 in the paper).
